Hello MTN5-HR Team,

Could you please provide an approve for the temporary schedule adjustment on "New Hire Orientation", based on the email received by the associate ? So, that we could avoid the 3 hours UPT deduction. Else, please provide an approval with the "New Code" to be coded as "Excused" time off, resulted in UPT refund. Moreover, you could also share the new code to be coded, or code the "new code" from your end.

Temporary Schedule Adjustment
Start Date: 05/09/2021

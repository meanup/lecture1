Hello MTN5-HR Team, 

Kindly review the below Ticket and provide approval for "Excused" Time off for the missing hours. As the associate was on LOA from 05/06/2021 to 05/12/2021, and RTW was updated on 05/13/2021. Due to a delay in updating the schedule, the associate was unable to view the shift in A to Z that resulted in missing hours and a UPT deduction of 4 hours.

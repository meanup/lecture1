Hello MTN5-HR Team,

Requesting you to kindly review the below Ticket and provide an approval for "Excused" Time off for the missing hours. As the associate was on LOA from 05/06/2021 to 05/12/2021, and RTW was updated on 05/13/2021. Due to delay in updating in the scheduled, the associate was unable to view the shift in A to Z that resulted in missing hours and an UPT deduction of 4 hours.
